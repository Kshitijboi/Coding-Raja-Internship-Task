Movie Recommendation System
This repository contains code for a simple movie recommendation system implemented in Python using Pandas.

Overview
The movie recommendation system utilizes the MovieLens dataset to recommend movies to users based on their preferences. It involves preprocessing the dataset, including cleaning movie titles, and then implementing a recommendation algorithm.

Features
Data Preprocessing: The dataset is preprocessed to clean movie titles by removing special characters using regular expressions.
Recommendation Algorithm: The recommendation algorithm suggests movies to users based on their preferences and similarities with other users' ratings.

Usage
Environment Setup: Make sure you have Python installed along with the necessary dependencies listed in requirements.txt.
Code Execution: Run the provided Python script to preprocess the data and implement the recommendation algorithm.

Dependencies
Python 3.x
Pandas
